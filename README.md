# CS320-Software-Test-Automation

  Throughout the course of CS 320 we have learned to write functional and secure software through the use of various testing techniques. These techniques, primarily in the form of static and dynamic testing with JUnit test cases, have been paramount in ensuring that software meets functional requirements and is secure. Whether it is being adamant about checking syntax through IDE errors when practicing static testing, or writing JUnit test cases for equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis tests, these testing techniques have helped me solidify my confidence in writing functional and secure software. Another important element that we have learned throughout CS 320 is our testing approach. The approach that I learned to use over the course included following the software requirements and using them as a guide when designing my test cases. This helps to ensure that every user need is verified and met according to the software requirements. Ultimately, the lessons learned in this course changed how I approach designing software. I have learned and recognized the importance of verifying software functionality through testing. I believe that software testing is critical to ensure that it meets needs and requirements and is also why I will continue to implement test cases whenever I design software.
